# Oystercard #

This week's challenge started with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving us the chance to reinforce what we learned last week. We were then challenged to build a more complex system which to stretch our skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

# Wider Course goals that this project contributed toward #

I write code that is easy to change
    Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.

I can test-drive my code
    Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.

I can build with objects
    Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.
